# 🔍 Binary Search in Python
An efficient implementation of the Binary Search algorithm in Python. This script allows users to input 20 numbers, sort them automatically, and perform an optimized binary search with O(log n) complexity.

## 🚀 Features
✔ Accepts **20 numbers** from the user and stores them in a list.  
✔ Uses `sorted()` to **sort the list** before searching.  
✔ Implements **Binary Search** with `O(log n)` time complexity.  
✔ Displays the **index of the searched number** (if found) or a "not found" message.  
✔ **Handles invalid inputs** to prevent errors.  
✔ **Beginner-friendly, well-structured code!**
